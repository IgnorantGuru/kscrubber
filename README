README for kscrubber


OVERVIEW
    
kscrubber is a tool for removing and cleaning specific system files, logs,
and user files, for the purposes of freeing disk space and removing recent
activity information.

 - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - 
Last tested with KDE 4.4 - By design, kscrubber is a fairly heavy-handed 
script that removes and modifies a large number of files belonging to the 
system, KDE, and users. While every attempt is made to avoid breaking 
software or causing system instability, these outcomes are not impossible. 
In the unlikely event any instability is encountered, a reboot should 
correct it, as many of the files that kscrubber removes are temporary files 
which will be automatically recreated by the system or software. 
Regardless, it never hurts to have a recent backup of your /home folder and 
your system. See How To Backup Operating Systems for help. In addition, 
kscrubber includes a built-in option to create backup copies of files it 
modifies (see below).
